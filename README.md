# Hi there, I'm Daniela Ramos Jord√£o üëã

After several years working in accounting, I realized that what truly drives me is solving problems and improving systems. This analytical and structured mindset naturally led me to software development, where I apply my expertise to build scalable and efficient solutions.
I‚Äôm currently deepening my skills at 42 Porto, a project-based, peer-to-peer programming school, through hands-on experience in C, C++, system logic, memory management, and computer science fundamentals.
Here, you‚Äôll find some of the projects I‚Äôm developing and contributing to. Always learning, always exploring.
